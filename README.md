## Project Overview

This project focuses on simulating the kinematics and dynamics of a 5-DOF robotic arm using MATLAB. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the arm's motion and behavior, including its position, velocity, and acceleration profiles, as well as the forces and torques acting on each joint.

## Features

- **Forward Kinematics:** Calculate and visualize the end-effector's position and orientation based on the joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics:** Compute the joint angles required to reach a desired end-effector position and orientation.
- **Dynamics Modeling:** Develop dynamic equations to analyze the arm's behavior under external forces and torques.
- **Motion Simulation:** Generate smooth trajectories for the robotic arm and visualize its motion in 3D space.
- **Force and Torque Analysis:** Evaluate the forces and torques experienced by each joint throughout the arm's movement.
- **Interactive GUI:** Provide an intuitive graphical user interface to input desired positions, visualize results, and analyze data.
